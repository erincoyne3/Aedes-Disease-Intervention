Biting Rate:
Baseline mosquito biting rate = 0.76/day (Table 2)

At 50% coverage (coverage being applied in model) biting rate = 0.8 * baseline (Figure 4)

(0.76/day) * (0.8) = 0.608/day

Daily Mortality:
Basline mosquito mortality rate = 0.18/day (Table 2)

Averge of acute and delayed mortality at 50% coverage = 0.4 * baseline (Figure 4)

(0.18/day) * 0.4 = 0.072/day
